/*
Some PRNG algorithms use multiple linear congruential generators with dif-
ferent constants and then select from among the values generated at each step
to make the numbers seem more random and to increase the sequenceâ€™s repeat
period. That can make programs produce more random-seeming results, but
those methods are still not truly random.
