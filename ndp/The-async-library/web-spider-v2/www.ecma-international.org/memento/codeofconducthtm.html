Version 2
              (approved by the Ecma GA in June 2016)<br>
                </span><img src="../images/MainLine.gif"></p>
<p>1. Ecma  considers it is desirable that fullest available information should be  disclosed to those selecting technology for Ecma International Standards and  those interested in adopting Ecma International Standards<sup>1</sup>. Ecma desires to  develop standards for which licenses for any essential patents are available on  a non-discriminatory basis and on reasonable terms and conditions. Therefore,  Ecma desires that any party participating in a technical committee of Ecma  International promptly disclose any patent or pending patent application that  it believes contain claims that may be required to implement an Ecma  International Standard, in accordance with the following provisions.</p>
              <p>                2. If an Ecma  International Standard is developed and a party may own or control a patent or  application with claims that are required to implement such Ecma International  Standard, three different situations may arise:</p>
              <p>2.1 The patent holder  is prepared to grant licenses free of charge to other parties on a  non-discriminatory basis on reasonable terms and conditions. Negotiations are  left to the parties concerned and are performed outside of Ecma International.</p>
              <p>                2.2 The patent holder  is prepared to grant licenses to other parties on a non-discriminatory basis on  reasonable terms and conditions. Negotiations are left to the parties concerned  and are performed outside of Ecma International. For patented technology contributed to and incorporated into a Final Draft Ecma  International Standard by a patent holder member, the patent holder member may  select 2.1 or 2.2.&nbsp; If such patent holder member does not make a  selection, 2.2 shall apply.<br>
                </p>
              <p>2.3 For patented  technology contributed by a party other than the patent holder, the patent  holder is not prepared to comply with the provisions of either Paragraph 2.1 or  Paragraph 2.2.</p>
              <p>3. Whatever case  applies (2.1, 2.2 or 2.3), the patent holder shall, for patents and pending  applications it owns or controls that it believes contains claims that may be  required to implement the identified Draft Ecma International Standard, provide  a timely written statement to be filed with the Ecma Secretary General at the  Ecma International Secretariat, using the attached &ldquo;Patent Statement and  Licensing Declaration Form for an Ecma International Standard&rdquo; (the &ldquo;Form&rdquo;  available&nbsp;<a href="/memento/patent statement and licensing declaration form.doc">here</a>&nbsp;in WORD format and&nbsp;<a href="/memento/patent statement and licensing declaration form.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;in PDF format).&nbsp; Any licensing  commitment selected will only apply to those claims that end up being required  to implement the Final Ecma International Standard.<br>
              </p>
              <p>3.1 In the event the  patent holder selects per Paragraph 2.1 and 2.2, the patent holder may identify  specific patents associated with box 1 or box 2 of the Form. If an Ecma member  does not identify specific patents on the list, the designated licensing  commitment will apply to all of the Ecma member's claims in patents and pending  applications it owns or controls that end up being required to implement the  finalized Standard. The patent holder may submit multiple Forms to document  additional patents, each Form applying to patents associated with one of the  boxes. A patent holder may re-designate as follows: Box selections cannot be  changed, except that identified patents may be re-designated from box 3 to box  1 or 2, or from box 2 to&nbsp; box 1. For licenses executed before a  re-designation, the licensees may continue under the existing license or may  request terms in accordance with the re-designation.<br>
                </p>
              <p>3.2 In the event a  patent holder selects per Paragraph 2.3, the patent holder must identify the  specific patents it owns or controls and believes are required to implement the  Ecma Standard in a Form under box 3.<br>
                </p>
              <p>3.3 The Form must not  include additional provisions, conditions, or any other clauses that may  interpret, restrict or vary the terms of the selected box on the Form.<br>
                </p>
              <p>4. Pursuant to Article  9 of the Ecma International by-laws, each Final Draft Ecma International  Standard to be approved shall be submitted two months ahead of a General  Assembly (GA).<br>
                </p>
              <p>4.1 Each Ecma member  participating in the development of the proposed standard shall, and other Ecma  members may, submit a Form at the latest two weeks before the GA (if the vote  occurs at the GA) or the end of the postal voting period (if the vote is by  mail), if they own or control any patents or patent applications that they  believe are required to implement such standard. For so long as such Standard  remains an approved Ecma International Standard, the member will be prepared to  grant licenses for its essential claims in patents and patent applications in  accordance with Paragraph 2 above.&nbsp; In the event Paragraph 2.3 is  selected, a patent license may not be available and the technical committee  should explore other options.<br>
                </p>
              <p>4.2 This Policy  creates no duty for Ecma members to search for any patents or patent  applications at any time.&nbsp; A Member&rsquo;s general licensing commitment shall  apply to the claims in any patents or patent applications that are required to  implement the Standard even if such patents are acquired by the Member after the  Standard is finalized.&nbsp; If Paragraph 2.1 or 2.2 is selected, a commitment  attaches to a Standard, then the same commitment would automatically apply to  future versions of the Standard if the same implicated patent claims (i) are  required for implementation of the revised Standard, and (ii) are used in a  substantially similar manner, to a substantially similar extent, to achieve a  substantially similar result as the same patent claims were used in the prior  version for which the Member has made a licensing commitment.<br>
                </p>
              <p>4.3 An Ecma member participating  in the development of the proposed standard that has not submitted  a Form regarding a Final Draft Ecma International Standard within the period  mentioned in Paragraph 4.1 is obliged to license any claims in patents or  patent applications required to implement the Standard on a reasonable and  non-discriminatory basis.<br>
                </p>
              <p>5. Anybody may  disclose, in written form identifying the title and patent information, another  party&rsquo;s&nbsp; patents and applications that it reasonably believes may be  required to implement&nbsp; an Ecma Standard.&nbsp; Such disclosure is not an  assertion that such patents or applications are required for the Ecma Standard,  but is provided for informational purposes. The Ecma Secretary General will, as  feasible, send a Form to each such potential patent holder. A non-member may  submit a Form to the Ecma Secretary General that lists the non-member&rsquo;s patents  and applications that it believes may be essential to a draft or final Ecma  Standard and select one of the options described above in Paragraph 2.<br>
                </p>
              <p>6. Ecma International  shall not provide legal opinions about evidence, validity or enforceability of  patents, or whether a claim is required to implement a standard. Accordingly,  in instances where a patent or pending patent application is disclosed to the  Ecma Secretary General and it is not subject to a license commitment in  accordance with boxes 1 or 2 of the Form, approval and publication of a  proposed standard is authorized if 2/3 of the GA by vote in person or via  letter ballot, support proceeding with the standard notwithstanding possible  uncommitted patent(s) and patent application(s) of Ecma members or non-members.  As a condition to proceeding, the Ecma Secretary General must provide notice of  all identified and possibly uncommitted patents or patent applications and  their disposal (if any) (i) to the voting members at least 10 days before the  vote on the standard will be completed and (ii) to the public if and when the  standard is published as final.<br>
                </p>
              <p>7. If a patent or  pending patent application, that is not subject to a license commitment in  accordance with boxes 1 or 2 of the Form, is disclosed to the Ecma Secretary  General after an Ecma International Standard has been approved, the process of  Paragraph 6 shall be followed to determine if the standard shall be continued,  withdrawn or modified.</p>
