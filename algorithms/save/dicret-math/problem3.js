/*
	After excavating for weeks, you finally arrive at the burial
	chamber. The room is empty except for two large chests. On
	each is carved a message (strangely in English):

	If this chest is
	empty, then the
	other chestâ€™s
	message is true.

	This chest is filled
	with treasure or the
	other chest contains
	deadly scorpions.

	You know exactly one of these messages is true. What should
	you do?
*/

/*
	Solution:
	chest1:
		chest1.p1: It is empty;
		chest1.p2: The other chest is true.

	chest2:
		chest2.p1: It is filled;
		chest2.p2: The other chest contains scorpions

	chest1.p1 => chest1.p2
	chest2.p1 || chest2.p1
