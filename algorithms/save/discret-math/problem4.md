Problem:

	While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls
	guarding a bridge. Each is either a knight, who always tells the
	truth, or a knave, who always lies. The trolls will not let you pass
	until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave. Each
	troll makes a single statement:
	Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two
	knights here.
	Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.
	Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is
	a knight.
	Which troll is which?

Solution:
	1 - T2 is lying;

	2 - T1 is not a scoundrel because the other two are not knight. T1 is lying. 
			Therefore, he is not a knight;

	3 - T3 is telling the truth because at least one of them is a knight.

	Response: T1 and T3 are knight. T2 is knave
